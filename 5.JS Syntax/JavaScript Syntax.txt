JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed
*JavaScript Values
    The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

    Fixed values:- Fixed values are called Literals.
    Variable values:-Variable values are called Variables.

*JavaScript Literals
    The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:
        1. Numbers are written with or without decimals
        2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes

*JavaScript Variables
    In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
    JavaScript uses the var keyword to declare variables.
    An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.
    Ex:- var a;
         a = 6;

JavaScript Operators
    JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values
    JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables

JavaScript Expressions
    An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
    The computation is called an evaluation.
    Ex:-10 * 5
        x * 10
        "John" + " " + "Doe"

JavaScript Identifiers
    Identifiers are names.
    In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables (and keywords, and functions, and labels).
    In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
    Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

JavaScript is Case Sensitive
    All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 
    The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables.

JavaScript and Camel Case
    Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
    Underscore:
        first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.
    Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):
        FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.
    Lower Camel Case:
        JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:
        firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
