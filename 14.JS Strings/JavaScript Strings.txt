JavaScript strings
    JavaScript strings are used for storing and manipulating text.
    A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.
        Ex:- var name="Roshan";
    You can use single or double quotes:

String Length(index38.html)
    To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:
        Ex:-var txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
            var sln = txt.length;

Escape Character(index39.html)
    used the backslash escape character

Breaking Long Code Lines
    You can break a code line within a text string with a backslash.

Strings Can be Objects(index40,html)
    strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:
    var firstName = new String("John");
    Don't create strings as objects. It slows down execution speed.
    When using the == operator, equal strings are equal:
    When using the === operator, equal strings are not equal, 
    because the === operator expects equality in both type and value
    Objects cannot be compared
