JavaScript Objects
    You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.
    This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:
    Ex:-var car = "Fiat";
    Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
    The values are written as name:value pairs
    Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:

Object Properties
    The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:

Accessing Object Properties(index35.html)
    You can access object properties in two ways:
        **objectName.propertyName
        **objectName["propertyName"]

Object Methods(index36.html)
    Objects can also have methods.
    Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
    Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.
    
The this Keyword
    In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.
    In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.
    In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.
