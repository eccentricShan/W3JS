A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.()(index31.html)
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas.

Function Return
    When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
    If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.
    Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.

Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.(index32.html)

Local Variables(index33.html)
    Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
    Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
